<h2>A update for Drift86</h2>

All the code included is **not** owned by me and was originally written by the rightful owner and belongs to the rightful owner.

**Saves NO passwords** or any user information it's just files.
**NOTE:** Not created for cheating purposes. All it does is change the code to fix a few problems. Use it as you see fit, accepting responsibility. I  **don't** take responsibility for what you do.

Download available at [releases page](https://github.com/MageSneaky/Drift86Update/releases).
